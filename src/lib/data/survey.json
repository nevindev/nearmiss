      "description": "<p>By completing this survey on <strong>nearmiss.me</strong>, you are helping to identify locations across your community where pedestrians and cyclists have experienced near miss incidents and other dangers.</p><p>A near miss incident is an event in which a driver of a vehicle or a person walking, running, biking, or scootering had to suddenly stop, swerve or otherwise move to avoid a collision.</p><p>A dangerous location is deemed dangerous to a person walking or biking. This information will be reported anonymously to regional municipalities and other transportation focused organizations to identify locations that would benefit from safety improvements but may have not been determined to be problem areas by traditional crash data sources. We will also use the near miss data, when appropriate, for street safety advocacy efforts with policymakers.</p><p>Our goal is to improve safety for area residents, employees, and visitors.</p><p>If you were involved in a crash, please report it to local law enforcement.<p>"

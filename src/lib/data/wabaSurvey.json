We’re so sorry if you’ve been in (or witnessed) a crash or altercation. We hope you’re OK. You can find more information on what to do after a crash here. This form will ask you questions so that we can gather information regarding traffic incidents in the Washington area to make sure that all road users are treated fairly by local government officials when they are involved in an incident and to track areas of concern to make sure we advocate for better infrastructure. <strong>The information you submit is not passed on to any police department or corporation and any names and email addresses will be kept strictly confidential.</strong> However, you will have the option to send your report to your local elected official and department of transportation to encourage them to make the necessary changes to the road. We may also use aggregated information from the database to illustrate issues facing road users—dangerous intersections, flawed administrative processes, or unsafe infrastructure. Please share our tool with friends and families. And feel free to bookmark the link on your phone and desktop web browser.</p><ul><strong>Helpful definitions:</strong><li>Near-Miss: A near miss is an unplanned event that doesn’t result in injury or death, but could have (definition taken from the National Safety Council).</li><li>Dangerous Location: Unsafe road conditions that are likely to cause a crash. Among them are deep potholes, uncleared ice and snow, and unannounced changes in the road surface (e.g., uneven lanes).</li></ul><p><strong>Families for Safe Streets Chapters</strong><br>Families for Safe Streets supports people who have been impacted by road violence.
